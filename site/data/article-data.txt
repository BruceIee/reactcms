It comes when your families collect Box Tops and someone sends them in on behalf of your school. It comes when you shop with your Red Card at Target.  And, it comes via eScrip when your parent community shops at Safeway and/or ShopRite using cash.  These efforts can raise hundreds and even thousands for your schools....easily!

Email Carol at Carols@sprintmail.com \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nCarol's Tip: Find several volunteers to handle the different programs.  Understanding each program's requirements and deadlines, and regularly promoting all the programs to school parents AND school staff, community members, co-workers (and to basically anyone who shops or goes to restaurants!!!) will ensure that your PTA and school earn this funding! \r\n</p>",
